            Stuck on Windows Insider build 20241.rs_prerelease.201016-1450
            I updated to this build by switching to the development channel in the Windows Insider configuration settings because of a previous build that I was stuck on becoming unsupported but now I can't get off of it despite serious stability problems notably with VMs. I need to be able to get off of it without losing data and without re installation of Windows. Currently Windows Update says that no updates are available to me regardless of what Windows Insider channel I select whether it be release preview, development or beta.
